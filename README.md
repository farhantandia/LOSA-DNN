# LOSA-DNN

A lightweight one-in-two stream attention-based deep neural network (LOSA-DNN) is proposed for the real-time human action recognition. The proposed LOSA-DNN is composed of 1) RGB image input without optical flow image, 2) EfficientNet B3, and 3) attention-based two-stream network consisting of 2D separable convolution neural network (CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) with two-path pooling.
